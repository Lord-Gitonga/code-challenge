// // Challenge 3 

// // Write a program whose major task is to calculate an individualâ€™s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. Calculate the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIFDeductions, NSSFDeductions, gross salary, and net salary. 
// declaring variables
let basicSlary, benefits, payee, NHIFDeductions, NSSFDeductions, grossSalary, netSalary;

// prompt user to enter basic salary

basicSlary = parseFloat(prompt("Enter your basic salary"));

// prompt user to enter benefits

benefits = parseFloat(prompt("Enter benefits"));

//prompt user to enter payee

payee = Math.floor((basicSlary + benefits)*0.25);

//prompt user to enter NHIFDeductions

NHIFDeductions = Math.floor((basicSlary * 0.03));

//prompt user to enter NSSFDeductions

NSSFDeductions = Math.floor((basicSlary * 0.05));

//prompt user to enter grossSalary

grossSalary = Math.floor(basicSlary + benefits);

//prompt user to enter netSalary

netSalary = grossSalary - payee - NHIFDeductions - NSSFDeductions;

// Showing the net salary
